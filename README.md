# ogd-dataloader

Dataloader for Open Data 

# Usage 

`config.yml` contains two fields:

```
download_url: "https://www.uvek-gis.admin.ch/BFE/ogd/102/ogd102_fuellstand_gasspeicher.csv"
file_path: output.csv
```

These can be adapted: the config file be read and the data will be downloaded from 
the `download_url` and written into `file_path` as output.
